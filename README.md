## ðŸ”­ About me

I am passionate about technology, particularly in Data Analytics and Data Science. I am very eager and excited to continue learning more about the field. My goal is to pursue what I love and never stop learning.
During my studies, I have acquired knowledge in Data Visualization, Python, Business Analysis for Data Science, MySQL, as well as proficiency in Excel and Tableau.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with any company in need of my skills. I am available to speak with anyone who would like to learn more about me and what I do.
